# Old School 2D Snake Game Clone written in React

## Motivation

No tutorial was used in the game dev. The game was written from scratch entirely by me using React for entertainment and learning purposes.

I wanted to learn & manage how to develop & build:
- game logic,
- game loop binded to timer,
- touch controler for touch screens.

As a side effect, I've refactored the code to adapt it for future use in case I want to build another game with game loop binded to timer, like... Tetris ;-)

Previously, I've built the game in JavaScript using p5.js library a year ago, but this time I wanted to do it in React without  external libraries for animations.
