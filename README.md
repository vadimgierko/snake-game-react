# Old School 2D Snake Game Clone written in React

The game was written entirely by me for entertainment and learning purposes. I have not used any tutorial to be able to test myself in writing logic & handle timer & event listeners. Previously, I've built the game in JavaScript using p5.js library a year ago, but this time I wanted to do it in React without libraries for animations.
