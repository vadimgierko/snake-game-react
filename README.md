# Old School 2D Snake Game written in React

The game was written entirely by me for entertainment and learning purposes. I have not used any tutorial to be able to test myself in writing logic & handle timer & event listeners. Previously, I've built the game in JavaScript using p5.js library a year ago, but this time I wanted to do it in React without libraries for animations.

The basic game is completed, but there is a list of features that I want to add, change or fix in the future:

## TO DO:

- [X] complete readme file
- [X] header text
- [X] footer text, links
- [ ] points
- [ ] timer => bind the game loop to the separated timer instead of setTimeout
- [ ] reset game
- [ ] buttons for phone screens
- [ ] speed control || levels with increasing speed
- [ ] fix the end screen when snake eats itself
- [ ] refactor => helper functions & game algorithm in app component
- [ ] gh pages
- [ ] bonus: background music
- [ ] bonus2: write a tutorial, how to build the game
