# Old School 2D Snake Game written in React

The game was written entirely by me for entertainment and learning purposes. I have not used any tutorial to be able to test myself in writing logic & handle timer & event listeners. Previously, I've built the game in JavaScript using p5.js library a year ago, but this time I wanted to do it in React without libraries for animations.

Play the game here: https://vadimgierko.github.io/snake-game-react/
CodeSandbox demo: https://codesandbox.io/s/snake-game-react-qreqki
Source code on GitHub: https://github.com/vadimgierko/snake-game-react

## TO DO:

The game is completed, but there is a list of features that I want to add, change or fix in the future:

- [x] complete readme file
- [x] header text
- [x] footer text, links
- [x] score
- [ ] timer => bind the game loop to the separated timer instead of setTimeout
- [x] reset game
- [x] buttons for phone screens
- [ ] speed control || levels with increasing speed
- [x] fix the end screen when snake eats itself
- [x] refactor => helper functions & game algorithm in app component
- [x] gh pages
- [ ] bonus: background music
- [ ] bonus2: write a tutorial, how to build the game
