# Old School 2D Snake Game written in React

The game was written entirely by me for entertainment and learning purposes. I have not used any tutorial to be able to test myself in writing logic & handle timer & event listeners. Previously, I've built the game in JavaScript using p5.js library a year ago, but this time I wanted to do it in React without libraries for animations.

Play the game here: https://vadimgierko.github.io/snake-game-react/
CodeSandbox demo: https://codesandbox.io/s/snake-game-react-qreqki
Source code on GitHub: https://github.com/vadimgierko/snake-game-react

## TO DO:

The game is completed, but there is a list of features that I want to add, change or fix in the future:

- [x] complete readme file
- [x] header text
- [x] footer text, links
- [X] controllers for touch screens
- [x] score
- [X] timer => bind the game loop to the separated timer instead of setTimeout
- [ ] ~~show game time~~
- [X] show total session time (all games time during the session)
- [ ] lose screen message with game time & score
- [x] reset game
- [x] buttons for phone screens
- [X] speed control || levels with increasing speed
- [ ] RWD =>
  - [ ] on mobiles must be no scrolling during the game, the biggest possible board & big controllers
  - [ ] find the perfect size for the desktop
  - [ ] => all above means, that I can't use px => use % or smth else instead
- [X] better styling
- [X] dark mode
- [X] separate component for timer (clock)
- [X] separate component for touch controllers
- [x] fix the end screen when snake eats itself
- [x] refactor => helper functions & game algorithm in app component
- [x] gh pages
- [ ] bonus: background music
- [ ] bonus2: write a tutorial, how to build the game
